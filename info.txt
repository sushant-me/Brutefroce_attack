Password Brute Force Demonstration - Information File
====================================================

How It Works
-----------
This educational tool demonstrates how brute force attacks work by:

1. Generating all possible character combinations
2. Systematically trying each combination
3. Tracking attempts and time elapsed
4. Displaying the cracking process in real-time

Technical Specifications:
- Character set: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 (62 possible characters)
- Max password length: 4 characters (for demo purposes)
- Total possible combinations: 14,776,336 (62^4)
- Demo limited to 4 chars to prevent browser freezing

Key Features:
----------------
üîì Educational brute force demonstration
‚è±Ô∏è Real-time attempt counter
‚è≤Ô∏è Time elapsed tracking
üö¶ Visual progress indicators
üìä Attempts-per-second calculation

Security Notes:
---------------
‚ö†Ô∏è This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY
‚ö†Ô∏è Runs 100% in your browser
‚ö†Ô∏è No passwords are sent to servers
‚ö†Ô∏è All processing happens locally
‚ö†Ô∏è Never use this for unauthorized testing

Usage Instructions:
-------------------
1. Enter a test password (1-4 alphanumeric chars)
2. Click "Start Attack" to begin demonstration
3. View real-time cracking progress
4. See statistics and attempted combinations
5. Click "Stop" to halt the demonstration

For Developers:
---------------
Files included:
- index.html (Main application structure)
- styles.css (All styling and layout)
- script.js (Brute force algorithm and UI logic)
- info.txt (This file)

Implementation Details:
-----------------------
Algorithm:
- Recursive combination generator
- Odometer-style character incrementing
- Asynchronous UI updates

Performance:
- Throttled UI updates for smooth performance
- Limited to 4 characters for demo stability
- Efficient stat tracking

Customization Options:
----------------------
1. Change max password length in script.js
2. Modify character set in script.js
3. Adjust UI update frequency
4. Change color scheme in styles.css

Educational Value:
------------------
Demonstrates:
- Importance of password length
- Exponential time complexity
- Why complex passwords matter
- Brute force attack mechanics
